<h1 id="welcometothelonggenelab">Welcome to the Long Gene Lab!</h1>

<p>We are part of the <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/medicine/department_of_biomedical_sciences">Department of Biomedical Sciences</a> and the Innovation Center in the <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/medicine">College of Osteopathic Medicine</a> at <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/">New York Institute of Technology (NYIT)</a>.<br>
  <br></p>

<p>Research in the Long Gene Laboratory directed by Dr. <a href="https://longgene-lab.github.io/members"><strong>Ying-Tao "Jerry" Zhao</strong></a> is focused on leveraging computational and multi-omics approaches to understand long genes, particularly their transcription, co-transcriptional processing, and evolution. We are also interested in discovering new biomedical information from omics data using Machine Learning algorithms.<br>
 <br></p>

<p>The lab utilizes multidisciplinary approaches including genomics, epigenomics, bioinformatics, computational biology, and mouse genetics.<br>
